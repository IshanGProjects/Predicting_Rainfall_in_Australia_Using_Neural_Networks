# About Dataset
## Context
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

# Content
- This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
- RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

# Source & Acknowledgements
Observations were drawn from numerous weather stations. The daily observations are available from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.

# Objective:
To develop a machine learning model using neural networks to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia based on weather data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

# Dataset:
The dataset is the "Rain in Australia" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.
